# Bixby Assistant


## Intro

* What it is?
  - Bixby is Samsung's digital assistant that lets you get stuff done using your voice. It is an evolution of S Voice. 
* History
  - Bixby is a virtual assistant developed by Samsung Electronics. It runs on various Samsung branded appliances, primarily mobile devices but also some refrigerators. Bixby was launched in 2017, replacing the S Voice assistant.
  - Bixby comes in three parts, known as "Bixby Voice", "Bixby Vision", "Bixby Home" (which has been recently replaced with "Samsung Free" in the latest One UI software update),which Samsung had recently started developing.

## How it works?

* What backend technology it use. 

  First, Bixby takes the userâ€™s natural language request and converts that to an intent, a structured representation of what the user what wants to get done. As a developer, you train Bixby with natural language utterances that guide Bixby in understanding the user's initial request and generating an intent.

  Then, Bixby uses the intent and the models you write to dynamically generate a program, or plan, to be executed. Your models describe concepts (things that Bixby knows) and actions (things that Bixby can do), and the intent describes a goal (what the user wants to accomplish). Bixby uses your concepts and actions to write a program to reach the goal.

  Finally, Bixby executes its plan. When Bixby reaches your actions, it runs JavaScript code that you write, as well as connects to your back-end web services. Bixby actions can also launch applications on the device.

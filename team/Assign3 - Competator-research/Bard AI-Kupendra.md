The parent company of Bard AI is Google. Bard AI is a conversational generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by Google AI, based on the LaMDA family of large language models (LLMs). It was developed as a direct response to the rise of OpenAI's ChatGPT

# How it works?
Here is a brief overview of how bard work:

It receive our query as text.
It process our query and identify the key concepts.
It search my knowledge base for information related to the key concepts.
It generate a response that is relevant to our query and that is consistent with its knowledge base.
It deliver the response to us in human-like text.

# whats actually is large language  model


A large language model (LLM) is a statistical model that is trained on a massive dataset of text and code. This allows the model to learn the patterns and relationships between words and phrases, and to generate text that is similar to the text it was trained on.

LLMs are typically trained using a technique called self-supervised learning. In self-supervised learning, the model is not given any explicit labels to learn from. Instead, it is given a task that requires it to use its knowledge of language to make predictions. For example, an LLM might be given a task of predicting the next word in a sequence, or of filling in the blanks in a sentence.

LLMs have been shown to be capable of a wide range of tasks, including:

Text generation: LLMs can be used to generate text that is similar to the text they were trained on. This can be used to create creative text formats, such as poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc.

Translation: LLMs can be used to translate text from one language to another.

Summarization: LLMs can be used to summarize text into a shorter, more concise version.

Question answering: LLMs can be used to answer questions about text.

Code generation: LLMs can be used to generate code in different programming languages.
LLMs are still under development, but they have the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with computers. They could be used to create more natural and engaging user interfaces, to generate more creative and informative content, and to automate tasks that are currently done by humans.

Here are some examples of large language models:

1 GPT-3: GPT-3 is a large language model developed by OpenAI. It is one of the most popular LLMs, and it has been used for a variety of tasks, including text generation, translation, and summarization.
2 LaMDA: LaMDA is a large language model developed by Google AI. It is similar to GPT-3, but it is specifically designed for dialogue applications. LaMDA has been used to create chatbots that can have natural and engaging conversations with humans.
3 PaLM: PaLM is a large language model developed by Google AI. It is the largest LLM ever created, with over 540 billion parameters. PaLM has been shown to be capable of a wide range of tasks, including text generation, translation, summarization, and question answering

# How it works?

* what backend technology is used in Bard ?

Bard uses a variety of backend technologies, including:

1) TensorFlow: TensorFlow is an open-source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. It is used by Bard to train and deploy its large language model.

4. Cloud SQL: Cloud SQL is a fully-managed database service that makes it easy to set up, maintain, manage, and administer your relational databases in the cloud. Bard uses Cloud SQL to store its metadata and configuration data.

* What NLP(natural lang processing. it is using 

Bard is using a variety of natural language processing (NLP. techniques, including:

1. Transformers: Transformers are a neural network architecture that is used for a variety of NLP tasks, such as text generation, translation, and summarization. Bard uses transformers to train its large language model.
2. Self-supervised learning: Self-supervised learning is a technique for training NLP models without any explicit labels. Bard uses self-supervised learning to train its large language model on a massive dataset of text and code.
3. Attention: Attention is a mechanism that allows NLP models to focus on specific parts of a text input. Bard uses attention to generate text that is relevant to the user's query.
4. Beam search: Beam search is an algorithm that is used to generate text from an NLP model. Bard uses beam search to generate text that is both fluent and grammatically correct.
Bard is still under development, and its NLP techniques are constantly evolving. However, the techniques listed above are essential to Bard's ability to function

## In addition to the NLP techniques mentioned above, Bard also uses a variety of other techniques, such as:

* Machine learning: Machine learning is used by Bard to improve its performance over time. Bard uses machine learning to learn from the feedback it receives from users, and to improve its ability to generate text, translate languages, and answer questions.
* Data mining: Data mining is used by Bard to extract insights from its training data. Bard uses data mining to identify patterns and relationships in its training data, and to improve its ability to generate text, translate languages, and answer questions.

my question - bard ai vs chat-gpt

## Response generated by chat-gpt ==
"**Bard AI**" and "**ChatGPT**" are both related to artificial intelligence, but they refer to different types of AI systems with distinct purposes:

**Bard AI:**
"Bard AI" is not a well-known or widely recognized term, so I'll assume you're referring to an AI system designed to mimic the creative abilities of a bard. In this context, "Bard AI" could potentially refer to a program that generates creative content such as poetry, songs, stories, or other artistic expressions using AI techniques. This kind of AI would focus on generating text or content with a creative and artistic flair, similar to what a bard would do in a fantasy setting.

**ChatGPT:**
ChatGPT is a specific implementation of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer. model developed by OpenAI. It's designed to engage in text-based conversations and generate human-like responses given a prompt or input. ChatGPT can provide information, answer questions, hold conversations, and perform tasks based on the input it receives. It's trained on a diverse range of text from the internet and can generate coherent and contextually relevant text in response to user prompts.

**Comparison:**
While both "Bard AI" and ChatGPT involve AI-generated content, they have different focuses. "Bard AI" seems to emphasize creative and artistic content generation, while ChatGPT is more general-purpose, aiming to provide human-like conversational interactions and information. Here are some key differences:

1. **Content Type:** "Bard AI" would likely specialize in creative content like poetry, songs, and stories, while ChatGPT can handle a broader range of conversational topics.

2. **Use Cases:** "Bard AI" might be used for entertainment, content generation, or even educational purposes related to creative writing. ChatGPT can be used for answering questions, customer support, brainstorming, and more.

3. **Training Data:** "Bard AI" might be trained on a specific dataset of creative works and artistic expressions, while ChatGPT is trained on a more diverse range of internet text.

4. **Interactivity:** ChatGPT is designed for interactive conversations, whereas "Bard AI" might generate standalone creative pieces without interactive elements.

In summary, the main distinction lies in the specialization of content generation (creative vs. conversational. and the intended use cases. "Bard AI" would be focused on creative expression, while ChatGPT is a versatile conversational AI model.

 ## Whats other people's view on this <assistant>

you tube link -https://youtu.be/svl_GIBRkSA

## List out 10-15 limitations this <assistant> / drawbacks / what things you personally didn't like about this <assistant> / Areas where it suck.

Here are 10 limitations of Bard AI:

1. **Accuracy:** Bard AI is still under development, and it can sometimes produce inaccurate or misleading information. This is because Bard is trained on a massive dataset of text and code, which includes both accurate and inaccurate information. Bard is still learning to distinguish between the two, and it sometimes makes mistakes.

2. **Bias:** The dataset that Bard is trained on may contain biases, which can be reflected in Bard's responses. For example, Bard may be more likely to generate text that is biased towards certain genders, races, or political viewpoints.

3. **Creativity:** Bard AI is capable of generating creative text, but it is not always consistently creative. Some of its responses may lack originality or may not directly address the questions asked. It can produce ambiguous or irrelevant answers or unoriginal content.

4. **Context:** Bard AI may not always be able to understand the context of a conversation. This can lead to Bard generating responses that are irrelevant or nonsensical. For example, if you ask Bard "What is the meaning of life?", Bard may respond with a definition of the word "life". However, if you ask Bard "What is the meaning of life to you?", Bard may be able to provide a more personal and meaningful response.

5. **Judgment:** Bard AI is not able to make judgments or decisions. It can only provide information and generate text. This means that Bard cannot be used to make important decisions, such as choosing a career or investing money.

6. **Ethics:** Bard AI is still under development, and there are concerns about its ethical implications. For example, Bard could be used to generate fake news or propaganda. It is important to use Bard AI responsibly and ethically.

7. **Security:** Bard AI is a powerful tool, and it could be used for malicious purposes. It is important to secure Bard AI and to use it only for legitimate purposes.

8. **Privacy:** Bard AI collects data about its users. This data could be used to track users or to target them with advertising. It is important to be aware of Bard AI's privacy policy and to use it only if you are comfortable with its data collection practices.

9. **Sustainability:** Bard AI requires a lot of energy to train and run. This energy could contribute to climate change. It is important to consider the environmental impact of Bard AI before using it.

10. **Accessibility:** Bard AI is not yet available to everyone. It is only available in certain countries and languages. It is important to make Bard AI accessible to everyone, regardless of their location or language.

here as we know that its in development state ,we can judge its feature!
